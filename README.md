# **Graphay**: AI-Powered Financial Process Automation 💰
Graphay, is an AI-powered financial process automation system designed to streamline and manage the entire lifecycle of an invoice, from initial receipt to final payment confirmation. Leveraging the LangGraph library, this system orchestrates a multi-step workflow, integrating various services and including human-in-the-loop checkpoints to ensure accuracy and compliance.

## Project Overview & Core Functionality 🚀

Graphay automates a complex accounts payable workflow by creating a stateful agent that intelligently manages the process for each invoice. The core of the system is a **Python**-based application using **LangGraph** to define and execute the workflow as a stateful graph. This approach allows for robust, concurrent processing of multiple invoices while handling asynchronous human-in-the-loop tasks efficiently.

### Key features include:

  * **Automated Invoice Ingestion**: Polling a dedicated email inbox for new invoices.
  * **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Using a **Document Intelligence Service** to parse and extract key data from invoices.
  * **Automated Validation & Follow-Up**: Validating extracted data and automatically sending follow-up emails for missing information.
  * **Human-in-the-Loop Approvals**: Staging invoices for approval and monitoring a **Discord server** for an approval decision from a designated team.
  * **Payment Verification**: Monitoring for payment confirmation and verifying transactions via a **public API** (e.g., Etherscan).
  * **Centralized Tracking**: Recording all invoice data, status, and decisions in a **Google Sheets** tracking system.
