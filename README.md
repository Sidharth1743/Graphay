# **Graphay**: AI-Powered Financial Process Automation
Graphay, is an AI-powered financial process automation system designed to streamline and manage the entire lifecycle of an invoice, from initial receipt to final payment confirmation. Leveraging the LangGraph library, this system orchestrates a multi-step workflow, integrating various services and including human-in-the-loop checkpoints to ensure accuracy and compliance.
---

## Project Overview & Core Functionality

Graphay automates a complex accounts payable workflow by creating a stateful agent that intelligently manages the process for each invoice. The core of the system is a **Python**-based application using **LangGraph** to define and execute the workflow as a stateful graph. This approach allows for robust, concurrent processing of multiple invoices while handling asynchronous human-in-the-loop tasks efficiently.

### Key features include:

  * **Automated Invoice Ingestion**: Polling a dedicated email inbox for new invoices.
  * **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Using a **Document Intelligence Service** to parse and extract key data from invoices.
  * **Automated Validation & Follow-Up**: Validating extracted data and automatically sending follow-up emails for missing information.
  * **Human-in-the-Loop Approvals**: Staging invoices for approval and monitoring a **Discord server** for an approval decision from a designated team.
  * **Payment Verification**: Monitoring for payment confirmation and verifying transactions via a **public API** (e.g., Etherscan).
  * **Centralized Tracking**: Recording all invoice data, status, and decisions in a **Google Sheets** tracking system.

## **Workflow Overview**

### **Automated Steps**

1. **Invoice Ingestion** ‚Üí Detects new invoice emails & downloads files.
2. **AI-Powered Extraction** ‚Üí Extracts vendor, date, amounts, line items, payment details.
3. **Validation** ‚Üí Checks for missing data, requests additional info if needed.
4. **Approval Staging** ‚Üí Logs invoice to Google Sheets & posts request in Discord.
5. **Human Approval** ‚Üí Approvers approve/reject & provide cost center.
6. **Decision Recording** ‚Üí Updates Google Sheets with decision.
7. **Payment Confirmation** ‚Üí Waits for transaction ID, verifies via Etherscan.
8. **Finalization** ‚Üí Records payment confirmation & marks invoice complete.

## Technical Details & Design

### Orchestration with LangGraph

The heart of this system is a **stateful graph** built with **LangGraph**. The graph's state is a dictionary that holds all relevant invoice data at each step (e.g., vendor name, status, approval decision, transaction ID). Each step in the workflow is a **node** in the graph, with edges defining the flow based on the current state.

This design enables:

  * **Asynchronous Checkpoints**: Nodes like `await_approval` are designed to pause the graph's execution for a specific invoice until a condition is met (e.g., a Discord message is received). This non-blocking approach ensures the system can continue processing other invoices concurrently.
  * **Error Handling & Retries**: The graph can be configured with error-handling logic to manage failed tool calls or invalid data, routing the process to a specific node for resolution.
