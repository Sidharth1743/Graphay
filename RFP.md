# Request for Proposal: AI-Powered Financial Process Automation

## 1. Introduction & Project Overview

We are seeking to automate a multi-step financial process related to accounts payable. The goal is to build a robust, AI-powered system that can manage the lifecycle of an invoice from receipt to payment confirmation.

The core of this project is to create an intelligent agent using **Python** and the **LangGraph** library. This agent will orchestrate interactions between various services (email, document analysis, internal messaging) and manage human-in-the-loop checkpoints for approvals.

This document outlines the process to be automated, the technical requirements for the solution, and the standards we expect to be followed.

## 2. The Process to Automate

The system will automate the following business workflow for processing invoices:

1.  **Invoice Ingestion**: The process begins when an invoice is received in a dedicated email inbox. The system must be able to poll this inbox, detect new emails containing invoices (either as attachments or links), and download the relevant files. The system must be able to handle extraneous emails, replies to email threads, and other case conditions without breaking. 

2.  **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: The system will use a **Document Intelligence Service** (e.g., an LLM with vision capabilities) to parse the invoice document (PDF, image, etc.) and extract structured data, including:
    *   Vendor Name
    *   Invoice Number & Date
    *   Due Date
    *   Line items (description, quantity, price)
    *   Total Amount & Currency
    *   Payment Details (e.g., bank account information)

3.  **Validation & Information Request Loop**:
    *   The extracted data is validated for completeness.
    *   The process for this invoice is paused until the information is provided. The system should send one follow-up reminder if there is no response within three business days.

4.  **Staging for Approval**:
    *   Once an invoice is complete and validated, its data is recorded as a new entry in a centralized **google spreadsheet-based tracking system**.
    *   Simultaneously, a notification is posted to a dedicated thread in a channel in a **discord server**, requesting approval from the designated `Approving Team`. This message should contain all relevant invoice details. A link to this message should be stored in the tracking system.

5.  **Human-in-the-Loop Approval**:
    *   The `Approving Team` reviews the invoice details in the messaging service. They can either "Approve" or "Reject" it. Done via a message in the discord thread. They approver may add additional information in the thread, that should not break the system.
    *   If approved, they must also provide a `cost center` for the expense.
    *   The system must monitor the messaging channel for this decision. If no action is taken within 24 hours, it should post a reminder in the same thread. This reminder loop continues until a decision is made.

6.  **Decision Recording & Payment Trigger**:
    *   The approval decision (`Approved`/`Rejected`), reason, and `cost center` are recorded in the central tracking system.
    *   If approved, a notification is sent to the `Approving Team` confirming that the invoice is cleared for payment.

7.  **Payment Confirmation Loop**:
    *   The actual payment is executed manually by the `Approving Team` through a payment platform of their choice.
    *   The system must then monitor for payment confirmation. This will be achieved by watching for a message in the thread containing a transaction ID.
 

8.  **Finalization**: Once the payment is confirmed, the transaction details are recorded in the tracking system, and the process for that invoice is marked as complete.
